React â€“ A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

Install React from Terminal:

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

If successful, you should be able to get version:

```
create-react-app --version
```

And create react project:

```
create-react-app <projectname>
```

Run project:

```
cd <projectname>
npm start
```

Expected output in terminal (and should auto open browser to port 3000):

```
Compiled successfully!

You can now view <project_name> in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000/
  On Your Network:  http://<your_ip_address>:3000/

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use yarn build.
